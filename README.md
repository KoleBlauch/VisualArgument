My visual argument is placing the focus on social media, and the impact it has had on young adults and teens. Somewhat ironically, the newfound obsession of cultivating one's image has led to lonliness, depression, and anxiety spikes with the younger generations. In a way, the over-saturation of pretty pictures - in terms of editing and of volume - has sucked the color out of everyday life. The phones we all hold close to us everyday have become a source of comparison and ungratefulness, with enough power to make a calm scenario feel rough and uneasy. This effect is so impactful that, for example, a child vacationing in Colorado is snowboarding, but on the ride up the lift he scrolls on instagram and sees a woman at the beach - suddenly he wishes he was there instead. This visual argument represents to the audience that the smartphone and social media are milking real life for the beauty and color it provides by highlighting this exact circumstance.
